My name is Salvador Aleguas and I am currently a sophmore at Cypress Bay High School.

I have a passion for and enjoy  anything computer related, especially

computer science. I do projects like these as hobbies and will not be maintaining them

24/7. But for whatever reason if you need to contact me, my email is in the footer of the website.
