    <p>
         My name is Salvador Aleguas, and I am currently a Junior at Cypress Bay High School. I have a passion for and enjoy  anything computer related, especially
         computer science. This project stemmed from my interest of solving a need I had, quite a common one at that: calculating my grade point average.

        After some research, and shifting through many other GPA calculators out there, alas, I could not find one that fit my needs. It was disappointing because
        every other program did not account for variables not present in the Broward County grading system, such as A+ or C- grades that do not exist. There is also
        credit hours which Broward County does not use either.

        So, like any other eager computer science student, I made my own! This program is specficially designed for Broward County schools, as it fits their grading system.
        It might work in some other school districts that are similar, and I hope I can help others with the time I spent on this project.
