        <h3><strong>How is GPA calculated?</strong></h3>

    <p>Reference the chart below. Take the value assigned for a grade(add respective values if weighted gpa)<br>
       multiply it by how many credits the class is worth, add up all the values and divide by the total amount of credits.<br>
       If in block schedule, make sure to include non-EOC classes for both semesters. You can usually get this information from virtural counselor.

  Cypress or Broward for that matter is strange for when it comes to GPA; 
  there is an awful lot of specifics and classes such as AICE that are not
  offered anywhere else. For unweighted, the "+" does not matter; it is worth .3 more
  in weighted. I also included options for AICE and no option for A+ or A- because those 
  are specific to Broward.
