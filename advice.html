    <p class = "introduction">
        So you know how your GPA is calculated(hopefully), well what of it? Now that I know what my GPA could be or why it is what it is, what's the point?

<div class = "Summary">

        Optimization.
    </p>
    <p class = "paragraph-3">
        Let's get down to the basics. Your class rank is determined by your weighted grade-point average(for Broward county atleast). Your weighted GPA
        is increased through classes of higher difficulty; as cited in <a href = "{{"/manual-calculation" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">the manual calculation tab</a>, AP/AICE/Dual enrollment
        classes can give you a whopping 2 extra quality points. This is important because as you take more classes, your GPA will increase less and less, so you need to start off strong.
    </p>
    <p class = "paragraph-4">
        First of all, if it's not too late then avoid taking high-school credit electives in middle school. An enormous amount of these are regular classes that will
        poison your GPA and cripple your head start. Only taking honors classes will leave you at a 5.0 Weighted GPA(assuming you get all A's), which is already crazy high.
        Maximize your gain by taking many college credit classes your freshman year(I recommend atleast 2) and using dual enrollment.
    </p>
    <p class = "paragraph-4">
         You might be thinking "I don't know how to sign up or do Dual enrollment" or "Doesn't it look bad on college applications?". First of all, signing up for dual enrollment is incredibly easy.
         Go to your guidance counselor and ask to sign up. They will give you a form to fill out with your desired classes and you may or may not have to take an aptitude test(these are usually easy though so don't worry).
         Now another concern is whether it looks bad on college apps. Dual enrollment classes only look bad if they offer it at the school you attend; however, there is some exceptions. If you know
         that there is a class at your school that will make your life miserable/make you fail, then it is explainable on a college app. Simply add in the extra comments section your explanation for taking the class.
