        <strong>How is GPA calculated?</strong>
    </h3>
    <p class = "introduction">
        Reference the chart below. Take the value assigned for a grade(add respective values if weighted gpa) multiply it by how many credits the class is
        worth, add up all the values and divide by the total amount of credits. If in block schedule, make sure to include non-EOC classes for both semesters. 
        You can usually get this information from virtural counselor.

<div class = "Summary">
    <p class = "paragraph-2">
        You might be wondering why The D and F grades are static no matter the class. It is because that quality points(the extra gpa points you get for taking classes above regular) only apply to grades that are considered passing: C and above.
        Broward/CBHS for that matter is strange for when it comes to GPA; 
        there is an awful lot of specifics and classes such as AICE that are not
        offered anywhere else.
    </p>
    <p class = "paragraph-3">
        For unweighted, the "+" does not matter; it is worth .5 more
        in weighted. I also included options for AICE/Dual Enrollment and no option for A+ or A- because those 
        are specific to Broward.
